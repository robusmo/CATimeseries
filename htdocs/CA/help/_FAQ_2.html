<b>2) Differences between a raster and a shapefile</b>
</p>
<p>
A raster consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell contains a value representing information, such as temperature. Rasters are digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps.

Shapefiles are a simple, format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, lines, or polygons (areas). The workspace may also contain dBASE tables, which can store additional attributes that can be joined to a shapefile's features.
