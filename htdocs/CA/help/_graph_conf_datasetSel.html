<h2>Graph configuration: dataset selection</h2>
<p> 
Select from the first list a valid value as "Climate Indicator":
<br>
<img src='./images/_graph_conf_datasetSel_fig1.png'>
<ul>
	<li>
	all: to load all available datasets;
	</li>
	<li>
	specific value: to load all available datasets that belong to this "Climate indicator";
	</li>
</ul>

The "Dataset" list will be loaded with all raster and vector datasets available on the system that belongs to the specific "Climate indicator".
<br>
If one "Climate indicator" is chosen:
<ul>
	<li>
	all: only one dataset can be choosen on the "Dataset list";
	</li>
	<li>
	specific value: one or more datasets can be choosen on "Dataset list";
	<br>
	<img src='./images/_graph_conf_datasetSel_fig2.png'>
	</li>
</ul>
<br>

Use:
<ul>
	<li>
	Ctrl key: to select/deselect "not consecutive" elements;
	</li>
	<li>
	Shift key: to select/deselect "consecutive" elements;
	</li>
</ul>
<br>
Click on the info button to open a dialog to show more info about all the datasets selected:

<br>
As the creation of the graph may take some time, It is important to analyze the frequency and date interval for all datasets selected.

<br>
<h2>Graph configuration: right y axes</h2>
<p>
In order to add one or more datasets shown on the right Y axes,
<br>
<img src="./images/graphY1Y2_moredataset.png" >
<br>
select each dataset as described on the previous page on the right column:
<br> 
<img src="./images/graphConf_y2.png" >
<br>
Take care when you select multiple datasets on the same graph: the time coverage could be different, therefore time taken to create the graph could take a long time.
