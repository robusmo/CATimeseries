<h2>A raster dataset</h2>

A raster consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell contains a value representing information, such as temperature. 
Rasters datasets are commonly digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps.
