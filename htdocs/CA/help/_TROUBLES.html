<h2>Graph does not display even though I selected one or more variables.</h2>
<p>
Graph creation can take some time: so first of all, have patience!
<br>
Then check if the selected area, point, box or geographical area, is over sea while a land layer has been selected. Check all dates that are available, and correct selected dates to available ones. If the problem persists, contact the web-site administrator (by email).

<h2>Map does not show a variable when I select it.</h2>
<p>
Using the metadata link or the information mask from the configuration graph, check that the selected month and year correspond with an available date. Check if the issue is due to a network problem. If the problem persists, contact the web-site administrator (by email).</p>

<h2>I selected a layer but the map is coloured pink.</h2>
<p>
This issue arises when there is a network problem on the machine that stores the selected layer. Try again later. If the problem persists, contact the web-site administrator (by email).</p>

<h2>Can I publish a graph in a personal publication?</h2>
<p>
Before publishing something, please read the layer copyright on the metadata web-page (click on <img src="./images/mViewDataSel_metadataImg.png"> on "Table of Contents" section), or contained in the downloaded Pdf document.
